          <p>I am an IT Professional with a background in Technical and Professional Communication. I blend these together to solve technical issues, set up networks, install software, and maintain servers. With my classes in Technical Writing, I make sure to document all important aspects of my work in order to carry efficiency forward regardless of who may come later. </p>
          
<p>I have had an interest in computers for a long time, having learned to build my first PC at the age of eight, and have used that curiosity to propel my knowledge further. I am knowledgeable in setting up, maintaining, and troubleshooting LAN and WLANs, DHCP, and DNS. I am also experienced in setting Static IP addresses, and connecting and installing many varieties of network printers. </p>
<p>During my work at Seven Peaks as a Cash Control Manager and IT Support, I created documents to help facilitate departmental functions, and to record methods of running the department. In addition, I handled the basic IT tasks around the park, including assisting with implementing a brand-new Point of Sale system. </p>
<p> My passion is finding new ways to adapt new technology to the projects I am on, and finding ways to implement it in an effective manner; doing so in the most cost efficient way. I love the challenge of troubleshooting and fixing errors, building new systems, and even upgrading old ones. </p>
<p> This portfolio site showcases some of the abilities I possess in both Technical Communication and in Information Technology. </p>
