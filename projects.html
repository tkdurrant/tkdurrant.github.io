            <p><b>Why:</b> As a reference for myself and any others who need the information. With IT, it is important to know how to do this.</p>
            
<p><b>How:</b> I used Microsoft Word to create the document, and my own knowledge to help supplement it, as well as visual aids.</p>
 
<p><b>What:</b> This guide instructs the reader on how to create an Ethernet cable from basic components.</p>

<p><b>Impact:</b> Allows users to create their own Ethernet cables, which saves money and allows them to form specific lengths of cable. </p>

        &nbsp;
        <p><b>Why:</b> As a project for a Space Exploration class at Utah State University, and to test my video editing abilities.</p>
        
<p><b>How:</b> I used the Windows 10 screen recording tool and the Windows 10 audio recording tools. </p>

<p><b>What:</b> Gives a brief explanation of the Curiosity Rover’s mission on Mars, stating its purpose and its future. This project showcases my abilities to improvise, using programs in a way they weren’t originally designed for.</p>

<p><b>Challenges:</b> I didn’t have any professional or proper video editing software. I overcame this using the basic Windows 10 screen recording tool to capture all video, then playing the audio I had recorded earlier at the same time as recording. </p>

            <embed src="Files/Cookbook Edit.pdf" width="500" height="375" type='application/pdf'>
			

            <p><b>Why:</b> As part of a group project for a class at Utah State University.</p>
            
<p><b>How:</b> Used an existing cookbook as the basis, involved use of Microsoft Word. </p>

<p><b>What:</b> This is an edit of a cookbook, improving upon the organization and presentation of the original. </p>

<p><b>Challenges:</b> We needed to make sure the recipes stayed on the same page in order to avoid bleeding over and forcing the reader to flip between pages, which would’ve reduced usability. The original instructions also needed to remain intact, however they needed to be brought into line with the wording of all recipes in the book in order to retain similarity.</p>
 
<p><b>Design Choices:</b> We chose to show all the ingredients just below the name of the dish as well as the name of the contributor. The ingredients were placed in two columns to allow for the best utilization of space, followed by the instructions afterwards. Any further notes on the recipe were added at the end and colored red to stand out. </p>
