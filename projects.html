			<h2><a href="Files/Cash Control Manual.pdf" target="_blank">Seven Peaks Cash Control Manual</a></h2>

            <embed src="Files/Cash Control Manual.pdf" width="500" height="375" type='application/pdf'>
			

            <p>While working at Seven Peaks as the Cash Control Manager, I recognized that the manual they had for the department was old and outdated and decided to create a new updated one. The idea was to make a manual to have a more effective and efficient means to communicate important information and proceedures of the department to future managers and employees of the Cash Control department. It ensures the proper methods of running the department are continued.</p> 
            
            <p> The manual also includes instructions on operating the Point of Sale System used at the park, a recommended organization of funds for each sales location in the park, instructions on operating machinery, etc. It centralized all important information for running the department, and gives future managers a how-to guide, ensuring there will always be an idea of what to do if they have never worked the department before.</p>

			<h2>Ethernet Cable Termination Guide</h2>
            &nbsp;
			

            <p>This guide was created to show how to create an Ethernet cable, allowing the reader to make the length whatever they wish. Going with my IT Technician experience, it is important to know how to do this, as it lets you create cables with no slack and makes it easy to organize. I created this project as a reference for myself, and for anyone else that needs the information.</p>

			<h2><a href="Files/Cookbook Edit.pdf" target="_blank">Cookbook Edit</a></h2>

            <embed src="Files/Cookbook Edit.pdf" width="500" height="375" type='application/pdf'>
			

            <p>This document came from an existing cookbook, but vastly improved upon the organization and presentation of the original. The format was standardized throughout, keeping similarity and ease of reading as the top priority. All recipes were given a layout of ingredients followed by instructions. This was part of a group project in class, for which I assisted in developing the style guide and worked on the last three pages of the document itself.</p>
            <p>The challenges with this document came from making sure all the recipes stayed on the same page in order to avoid bleeding over and forcing the reader to flip between pages. We also had to make certain to keep the original instructions intact, while making them more alike the wording of the other recipes. </p>
